# Contributing
All the of OSX Rift's guide section is [available on Github][repo] to enable an easy medium for community wide collaboration. You don't have to be familiar with git to get started because Github itself provides a whole host of tools to let you get started contributing.

## Writing
All of the guides are written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax). Markdown is an easy-to-write document markup syntax in plain text that converts to HTML easily. It's syntax is very easy to learn and there's a plethora of tools available to help you get started with it.
